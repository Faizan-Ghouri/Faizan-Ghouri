I am a Software Quality Assurance Engineer with hands-on experience in manual testing, Android and iOS app testing, compatibility testing, performance testing, and API testing. My passion for ensuring software quality is matched only by my love for travel and exploration. While I consider myself a laid-back and lazy enthusiast, I thrive on finding bugs and maintaining high-quality software. Whether I’m riding bikes or discovering new places around the globe, I always bring an enthusiastic curiosity to both my work and my adventures.
